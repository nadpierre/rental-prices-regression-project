# Canada Rental Prices Regression Project

This project analyses the rental prices all accross Canada and explores different regression models to find one that predicts the price the most accurately.

## Data source

We will work with a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sergiygavrylov/25000-canadian-rental-housing-market-june-2024) containing rental prices for units in across Canada in 2024.

The dataset was obtained from [rentfaster.ca](https://www.rentfaster.ca).
